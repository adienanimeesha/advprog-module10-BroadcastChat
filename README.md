## Original broadcast chat code
![Alt text](broadcastchat.png)
This is run with cargo run--bin server first and then three terminals for cargo run --bin client. Each client terminal displays “Welcome to chat! Type a message." When something is typed and soon entered into the client terminal, that client sends the text to the server. The server will then log it (e.g. From client 127.0.0.1:62579 "hello", from the screenshot attached). The server will then rebroadcasts “hello” to everyone on its Tokio broadcast channel, and to all three clients instantly.
